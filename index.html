            <p>Ultimately, Albert only needed 20 minutes to get the image he wanted. His approach, as often was the case when practicing his craft, was to keep it simple. He dipped into his impressive ability to read people. This shot is exceptionally powerful
                because it portrays Steve Jobs the man. Albert achieved this effect by thinking about a passport photo. He set up the shot against a white background, asked Steve Jobs to lean slightly forward and said to him, “Imagine you are across the
                table from four or five people who don’t agree with you, but you know you are right”. He gazed into the camera and in that moment, Albert captured the intensity, intelligence and conviction that was Steve Jobs’ genius. Upon leaving, Steve
                Jobs glanced at the polaroid and asked if he could have it. He said it was “maybe the best picture ever taken of me.”</p>
